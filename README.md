# errsole-postgres

PostgreSQL storage plugin for Errsole.

## What is Errsole?

Errsole is a Node.js logger with a built-in web dashboard. In this dashboard, you can easily view, filter, and search your app logs.

If your application uses PostgreSQL as its database or if you prefer storing your application logs in PostgreSQL, you should install both the `errsole` and `errsole-postgres` modules. This setup allows you to store your application logs directly in your PostgreSQL database.
